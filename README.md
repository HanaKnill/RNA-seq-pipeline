# RNA Seq Pipeline 

### Project Outline

Create a RNA seq pipeline the 
1. Reads in fasta files 
2. Checks for quality 
3. Trims off ends
4. Aligns to template genome using Hisat2
5. Counts reads 


### Tools to download
1. Java - Needed for Trimmomatic
2. Trimmomatic - to trim ends of reads that don't pass quality check 
3. FastQC - Quality control for fasta files
4. SRA tools - to extract files from NCBI. Make sure to configure
5. Samtools?
